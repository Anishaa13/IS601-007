<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Did you have any issues during setup and if so how did you resolve them, otherwise what did you learn?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Initially faced an issue with the syncing of dev with other branches created<br>for the deployment which led to files getting missed when checkout to the<br>dev branch. Later, I was able to resolve the same using proper pull<br>request and syncing the two files.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to create, operate, and manage<br>containerized applications. These containers integrate the source code with the necessary OS libraries<br>and dependencies to run the application. Both the application and the infrastructure may<br>be controlled independently. It includes all of the requirements needed to run an<br>application. Additionally, it automates software in lightweight containers.</div><div>Deployment action .yml files are created<br>for two dynos/ virtual machines which are created in Heroku i.e dev and<br>prod. If the dev branch changes, the code in the.yml files contains an<br>automatic push; similarly, we may add more branches to automate pull requests. Following<br>action instructions, the database URL, port, and working directory are supplied. The docker<br>container is built, pushed, and released to the Heroku app using key secrets<br>previously added to GitHub such as email, API key, app name, and so<br>on. Also, mention the docker build instructions. In the dockerfile, the python:3.10-slim image<br>is used as the base image. Configure environment variables such as the port<br>and copy the local code to the container image. Install the requirements file<br>and run the web service with one worker process and eight threads on<br>container startup. If there are numerous CPU cores, increase the number of employees.<br>This way we can deploy our application on the Heroku app. We can<br>even change the hyperlink and deploy the app on other dynos by simply<br>making small changes to URL. In this homework, we created an application on<br>dev, same can be deployed on prod once the code is merged from<br>dev to prod branch.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Heroku is a container-based cloud service platform that enables easy and simple application<br>deployment of modern applications. It enables users to deploy applications onto the cloud<br>infrastructure. New apps/ dynos have created that work as building blocks/ containers. Applications<br>are scaled based on the dynos created.&nbsp;<div>Heroku is chosen for this class because<br>it is open-source software and requires knowledge of only a few commands to<br>deploy and run applications efficiently. It provides a good developers experience for beginners.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a microframework for developers that allows for quick application development and<br>scalability. It is a web application framework that provides back end components to<br>aid in the creation of applications. Built-in code packages automate operations, reducing the<br>amount of effort and coding necessary for application development. Flask is a web<br>framework and a Python module that allows you to quickly develop applications.&nbsp; It<br>has various features such as URL routing and a template engine, which we<br>can simply employ in Heroku for application development.&nbsp;It does not require any specific<br>tools or libraries, although it does support extensions that can add application capabilities<br>as if they were built into Flask itself.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The .yml action file is a metadata file that allows branch modifications to<br>have various ramifications. All of the instructions and information for the actions and<br>related triggers are contained in the.yml file. The.yml files contain an automatic push<br>based on the branches mentioned. Following action instructions, the database URL, port, and<br>working directory are supplied. It is a file in which we establish our<br>workflow; in this file, we may specify things like branch name, directory, and<br>so on, and we can later utilize this file to construct our app.<br>Whereas a Dockerfile is a text file that provides all of the command-line<br>instructions for building an image. We may include the port number, prerequisites, and<br>so on in the Dockerfile. The docker image is python:3.10-slim, and a special<br>configuration file is utilized. It helps our flask application run more smoothly.</div><br></td></tr>
